# Hackathon
Random Team
    
We have selected the topic cricket match predictor. We have gathered the data set from net to train our model.
We have used 75% data to train it and 25% to test it.
We are going to predict based on the following features: Venue, Toss, runs and wickets that is very crucial for team to win.

To predict the scores, we are going to use both classification and decision tree as we want to compare 
between the two.
We will diplay graphs of both the models and win percentage(Confusion matrix) using flask and we will compare
the results.
